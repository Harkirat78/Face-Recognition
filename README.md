# Face-Recognition

## Real-Time Face Detection Web Application

## Project Context 
This project was developed during my co-op position at OVC, which concludes in December 2024. Due to time constraints and prioritizing primary work responsibilities, I focused on implementing core face detection functionality using face-api.js. While the foundation for advanced features like age, gender, and expression analysis was planned, I prioritized delivering a functional face detection system that accurately identifies and tracks faces in real-time.
